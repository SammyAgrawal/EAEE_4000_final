# MLforEnvEng
Respository for all my work for the class Machine Learning for Environmental Engineering, taken at Columbia University.

My main work that was in the final report lies in the FaIR V2 Notebooks. The general scaffolding for the environment and runs is in Fair 2 Model.ipynb file. Fair2.1.ipynb was me learning to use the interface and various trials I did with different climate parameters. The successful runs for each experiment were given their own notebook for clarity. Therefore to create my report findings, run Experiment 1,2,3.ipynb. 

I did also implement a model in FaIR 1.6.4 and tested a RL model on it but did not run any significant experiments. However there is heavy modification to the code in the appendix of the original work for greater readability and usability. 

RL Gym can be ignored, that was me gaining more practice with Reinforcement Learning but was a very minor component.
